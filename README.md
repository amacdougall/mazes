# mazes

A playground for maze algorithm experimentation. Beginning with exercises from
Jamis Buck's book _Mazes for Programmers_.

## Usage

To run tests, `lein test` or `lein test-refresh`. You may wish to alter the
`:test-refresh` settings in project.clj.

To run the demo webapp, `lein figwheel` and then load `localhost:3449` as usual.
